# Application of Clustering Methods to Sporulation Yeast Microarray Data

## Description
This project focuses on applying clustering methods, specifically the k-Means algorithm, to sporulation yeast microarray data. The goal is to analyze the clustering performance and compare the results with those from published studies. The project includes code, a written report, a video presentation, and additional deliverables.

## Project Structure
- **Introduction**: An overview of the sporulation process in yeast and its biological significance.
- **Methods**: Application of the k-Means algorithm and use of the silhouette index to quantify clustering results.
- **Results**: Comparison between the obtained clustering results and those from previous published works.
- **Conclusions**: A summary of the most relevant findings from the analysis.
- **References**: Papers and resources used in the project:
  - [Ref. 1] The Transcriptional Program of Sporulation in Budding Yeast.
